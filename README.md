# COVID-19 public dataset on GCP from cases in Italy
> by the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (ISMIR)

This repository contains all the code required to extract relevant information from pdf documents published by ISMIR 
and store raw data in  a relational database and entities in a No-SQL database.

In particular, you will use Google Cloud Vision API and Translation API, before storing the information on BigQuery. 
Separately, you will also use specific NER models (from Scispacy) to extract (medical) domain specific entities and 
store them in a NoSQL db (namely Datastore) on Google Cloud Platform.

## Installation
**Requirements:**
- Clone this repo to your local machine using https://github.com/azizketari/covid19_ISMIR.git
- You need a Google Cloud project and IAM rights to create service accounts.
- Enable APIs
```
gcloud services enable vision.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable translate.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable datastore.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable bigquery.googleapis.com
```

- Install package requirements:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


Note:

You will also need to download a NER model for the second part of this pipeline. See Scispacy full selection of 
available models [here](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/). If you follow this installation guide, the steps 
will automatically download a model for you and install it.


## Extracting data
- **Step 0:** Navigate to the cloned repo on your local machine
 
`cd ~/covid19_ISMIR`

- **Step 1:** Modify the values to each variables in env_variables.sh file then run

```
./env_variables.sh
```

- **Step 2:** Download the required files to your bucket and load the required model in your local  
(this step will take ~10 min)

```
sh ~/data/download_content.sh
pip install -U ./scispacy_models/en_core_sci_lg-0.2.4.tar.gz
```

- **Step 3:** Start the extraction of text from the pdf documents  

`python3 extraction.py`

## Pre-processing data
Following the extraction of text, it's time to translate it from Italian to English and curate it.

`python3 preprocessing.py`

## Storing data
Following the pre-processing, it's time to store the data in a more searchable format: a data warehouse - 
[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) - for the text, and a No-SQL database - 
[Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore) - for the (UMLS) medical entities. 

`python3 storing.py`

## Test
Last but not least, you can query your databases using this script.

`python3 retrieving.py`
